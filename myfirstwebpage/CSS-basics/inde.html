    <h1>Course Description</h1>
    <p>
        sometimes I really don't understand why I am even in this class. I am failing this class this is the first time
        in so long I fear that I will literally fail and disappoint myself with the result. I have always tried to learn
        how to do the work and study this class but IDK why everytime I try, I still fail. This class is just not for me
        fr, I like the professor but damn
